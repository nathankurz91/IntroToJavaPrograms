Random notes from "Intro to Java Programming 10th Ed."
------------------------------------------------------



- Static variable: 
    - shared by all objects of the class
    - If you want all instances of a class to share data, us static variables (class variables)

- Static method: 
    - cannot access instance members of the class
    - can be called without creating an instance of the class
- Data Field Encapsulation
    - Making data fields private protects data and makes the class easy to maintain

- Arrays of objects
    e.g.
        Circle[] circleArray = new Circle[10];

        Initialize circleArray --->

        for (int i = 0; i < circleArray.length; i++) {
            circleArray[i] = new Circle();
        }

- Immutable objects and classes
    - You can define immutable classes to create immutable objects. The contents of 
      immutable objects cannot be changed
    - If a class is immutable, then all of its data fields must be private and cannot 
      contain public setter methods for any data fields.
